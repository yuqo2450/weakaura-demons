== General
This WeakAura displays a progressbar for each Wild Imp or Dreadstalker summoned. The displays of these progressbars are highly customizable with the default options in the WeakAuras GUI.

== Usage
=== Installation
To use this aura, copy the string from https://github.com/yuqo2450/wow_wa_demons/blob/main/Minions.txt[Minions.txt] and import it in WeakAuras.

=== Wild Imps
The Aura is structured by a dynamic group that contains two progressbars for Wild Imps and Dreadstalkers. If you want to display only one of those, just unload the one you don't want to display via the default WeakAura GUI settings.
The value displayed for each Wild Imp is the power that is used for the Wild Imp fire bolt. Each bolt consumes 20 Energy when they run out of Energy they will disappear.

=== Dreadstalkers
Dreadstalkers are time based, therefore the progress value reflects the time until they disappear.
